/*QUESTION NUMBER 2:Imagine a publishing company that markets both book and audiocassette
versions of its works. Create a class publication that stores the title (a
string) and price (type float) of a publication. From this class derive two
classes: book, which adds a page count (type int), and tape, which adds a
playing time in minutes (type float). Each of these three classes should
have a getData() function to get its data from the user at the keyboard, and
a putData() function to display its data.
Write a main program to test the book and tape classes by creating
instances of them, asking the user to fill in data with getData(), and then
displaying the data with putData().*/
